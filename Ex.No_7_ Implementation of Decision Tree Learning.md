## <p align="center"> EX.NO : 7 -- Implementation of Decision Tree Learning ... </p>

## DATE : 18-10-2024
## REGISTER NUMBER : 212221240005

## Aim :

Design a decision tree for following data. 

Healthy, In Cover, With Ammo -> Attack
Hurt, In Cover, With Ammo -> Attack
Healthy, In Cover, Empty -> Defend
Hurt, In Cover, Empty -> Defend
Hurt, Exposed, With Ammo -> Defend

## Algorithm :

### Step 1 :

Start the program.
   
### Step 2 :

Import the necessary packages.
   
### Step 3 :

Design a training data and test data.
   
### Step 4 :

Create a decision tree classifier model.
   
### Step 5 :

Output the predictions.
     
### Step 6 :

Visualize the decision tree.

## Program :

```python

from sklearn import tree
import pandas as pd

# Data: [Health, Cover, Ammo, Exposed]
# Health: 1 for Healthy, 0 for Hurt
# Cover: 1 for In Cover, 0 for Exposed
# Ammo: 1 for With Ammo, 0 for Empty
# Exposed: 1 for Exposed, 0 for In Cover
# Actions: 0 for Defend, 1 for Attack

# Define the training data and corresponding labels (actions)
data = [
    [1, 1, 1],  # Healthy, In Cover, With Ammo -> Attack
    [0, 1, 1],  # Hurt, In Cover, With Ammo -> Attack
    [1, 1, 0],  # Healthy, In Cover, Empty -> Defend
    [0, 1, 0],  # Hurt, In Cover, Empty -> Defend
    [0, 0, 1],  # Hurt, Exposed, With Ammo -> Defend
]

# Labels: 1 for Attack, 0 for Defend
labels = [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]

# Create a Decision Tree Classifier model
clf = DecisionTreeClassifier(criterion="entropy")

# Train the model
clf.fit(data, labels)

# Make predictions (example data points)
test_data = [
    [1, 1, 1],  # Healthy, In Cover, With Ammo
    [0, 0, 1],  # Hurt, Exposed, With Ammo
    [1, 1, 0],  # Healthy, In Cover, Empty
]

# Predict actions for the test data
predictions = clf.predict(test_data)

# Output the predictions
for i, pred in enumerate(predictions):
    action = "Attack" if pred == 1 else "Defend"
    print(f"Test case {i+1}: Predicted action is {action}")

# Optional: Visualize the decision tree
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
tree.plot_tree(clf, feature_names=['Health', 'Cover', 'Ammo', 'Exposed'], class_names=['Defend', 'Attack'], filled=True)
plt.show()

```

## Output :

![games_7_out](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0e9b7d91-4f0c-4301-b5d3-fffada403f27)


## Result :

Thus, the optimum value of max player was found using minimax search.
